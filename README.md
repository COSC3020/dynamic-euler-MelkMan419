# Dynamic Programming Euler's Number

The mathematical constant $e$ (Euler's number) is defined as follows:

$$ e = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0} \frac{1}{i!} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} +
\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot
4} + \ldots$$

I've provided an implementation of a function to approximate $e$ up to a number
of $n$ terms in `code.js` for you. However, it does repeated work -- identify
where the repeated work occurs and avoid it through bottom-up dynamic
programming (not memoization). Change the implementation accordingly.

Test your new functions; I've provided some basic testing code in `code.test.js`
but you need to go beyond that.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ time complexity of your algorithm?

The loop iterates from 1 to n, performing constant-time operations in the loop. In each iteration of the loop, there are two main operations, calculating the factorial, which requires multiplying i with the previous value which takes $\Theta$ (1) time and adding the reciprocal of the factorial to the sum which also takes $\Theta$ (1) time.

Since both operations within the loop have a constant time complexity and the loop iterates from 1 to n, the overall worst-case time complexity of the function is $\Theta$ (n).
